# Hardly Testable Cat Facts App

This is a hardly testable example of an application that:

1. Connects to the [Cat Facts](https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com) Online Web Service.
2. Retrieves and parses a list of cat facts that are encoded in [JSON - JavaScript Object Notation](http://www.json.org).
3. Shows a random cat fact to the user by the standard output

To execute it from command line:

* Linux/Mac: `./gradlew run`
* Windows: `gradlew.bat run`
